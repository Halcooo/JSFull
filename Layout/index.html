          A husky is a sled dog used in the polar regions. One can differentiate
          huskies from other dog types by their fast pulling-style.[citation
          needed] Modern racing huskies (also known as Alaskan huskies)
          represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest dogs[1] (the
          Alaskan Malamute, by contrast, pulled heavier loads at a slower
          speed).[2] Humans use huskies in sled-dog racing. Various companies
          have marketed tourist treks with dog sledges for adventure travelers
          in snow regions.[3] Huskies are also kept as pets, and groups work to
          find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure-trekking dogs.[4]

        <h2>Charecteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Huskies are energetic and athletic. They usually have a thick double
          coat that can be gray, black, copper red, or white.[9] The double coat
          generally protects huskies against harsh winters and, contrary to what
          most believe, they can survive in hotter climates. During the hotter
          climates, huskies tend to shed their undercoat regularly to cool their
          bodies. In addition to shedding, huskies control their eating habits
          based on the season; in cooler climates, they tend to eat generous
          amounts, causing their digestion to generate heat, whilst in warmer
          climates, they eat less.[10] Their eyes are typically pale blue,
          although they may also be brown, green, blue, yellow, or
          heterochromic. Huskies are more prone to some degree of uveitis than
          most other breeds.[11] Hunting instincts can still be found in some of
          this breed today[12]
